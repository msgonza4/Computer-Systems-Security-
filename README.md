# 📂 Digital Forensics Case: Simulated Phishing Incident Analysis

This repository contains the documentation and evidence analysis for a simulated digital forensics case involving a **phishing attack targeting confidential user information**.

The goal of this project was to:
1.  **Simulate** a complete social engineering/phishing incident.
2.  **Conduct** a full forensic investigation on the affected systems and captured data.
3.  **Produce** a comprehensive Final Forensic Report detailing the attack vector, analysis findings, and timeline of events.

# This project is a hands-on exploration of computer system vulnerabilities with a focus on confidentiality. It demonstrates how a real-world phishing attack works by simulating a fake login page and email lure to show how unauthorized individuals can trick users into divulging confidential information, highlighting the risks of data breaches, identity theft, and social engineering in a safe, educational environment.
